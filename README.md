**Image Forgery Detection using Schaar Operator and GLCM Matrix (CASIA Dataset)**

Image forgery detection is an active direction of research in the image forensics discipline. Moving a region from one image into another image, combining two images to form one image, or retouching an image are just a few examples of how an image can be doctored. Graphic designing applications like Adobe Photoshop can easily be abused to manipulate images. Furthermore, the advancements in AI like generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made it easier for someone to generate tampered images. These generated images are so flawless that it becomes challenging for even humans to detect a tampered image.

The project revolves around implementing a solution for detecting image tampering by leveraging deep learning methodologies.
